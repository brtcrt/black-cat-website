                <p class="about-short">
                    I'm brtcrt, a Turkish student who likes to code stuff. 
                    I mostly work with node.js and python.
                    This was my first attempt at creating a somewhat alright webpage.
                    That might be why it looks a bit shit but hey, you try you learn!
                </p>
                <h4 class="long-about-title">
                    Longer Introduction:
                </h4>
                <p class="about-long">
                    I've started programming when I was 13 or something and ever since then I've been trying to improve myself.
                    That was the actual reason I even created Bläck Cät. 
                    As you can probably tell, I mostly code Discord bots.
                    I didn't say always, I said mostly.
                    I also write webpages, although that's kind of new to me so I'm trying to make shit up along the way.
                    That is the reason I chose a minimalistic design as well. Well, that's just half of the truth. I chose this because:
                    One, It was super easy to write the CSS, and two, I liked the way it looked with the color gradient text.
                    Oh and also, If you haven't figured it out yet, I like color gradients a lot. A. Lot.
                    I wanted to learn something new so I picked up node.js and started to code a Discord bot.
                    I thought it was a fun idea since me and all my friends use Discord to talk to one another.
                    It didn't take long for my ";" key to get worn off, if you know what I mean.
                    It was hard at first, trying to learn all the syntax but since I knew a bit of python at the time, it didn't take too long for me to get used to it.
                    After spending a month or so just experimenting, I decided to show some of my friends the first-ever bot I made. 
                    We played with some of the stuff and had a lot of fun.
                    Ever since then, I've been trying to improve that same bot.
                    I like to think that I managed to make it somewhat more functional, considering the only thing the older brother of Bläck Cät could do was
                    respond to some messages.
                    Another thing I like to do is playing games. Who doesn't like playing games though really?
                    I mostly play osu! these days. <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14934074">Here is the link to my profile.</a>
                    Still trying to get out of 6 digit hell as you can see. Wish me luck!
                    I will continue to develop this bot until I get bored or I think it doesn't need any more commands.
                    I can't keep the bot up and running 24/7 yet, which is sad but I'm trying to find a way to solve that.
                    If you want you can check out <a href="https://github.com/brtcrt">my github</a> too, although it is a bit empty currently.
                    You can also support me on <a href="">patreon</a> if you like.
                    And uhh, I think that's it from me! Thanks for reading all that.
                    If you want to learn more about me, you can just write to me on Discord brtcrt#5538 or <a class="link-server" href="https://discord.com/invite/jXQvBj4tup">join the server!</a>
